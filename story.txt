# Saga of the Northern Flame

In the cold reaches of the north, warriors lived by the sword and died by honor. Among them was a young boy named Eirik, son of a retired war hero who now lived a peaceful life as a farmer.

Eirik idolized the world of battle, believing glory could only be won on the battlefield. But his father, once a feared commander, taught him otherwiseâ€”warning that true strength lies in knowing when not to fight.

Everything changed when a band of mercenaries attacked their village. Eirik watched helplessly as his father was struck down, refusing to raise his blade.

Grief-stricken and confused, Eirik vowed to seek revenge against the leader of the mercenaries.
